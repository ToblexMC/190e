                The design of the Mercedes-Benz 190E was a collaborative effort that involved several key individuals and teams within the company. The project was led by Mercedes-Benz's Chief Engineer at the time, Dr. Werner Breitschwerdt, who played a crucial role in overseeing the development of the car. The styling and design work were primarily carried out by a team of designers led by Bruno Sacco, Mercedes-Benz's head of design during that era. The design process took place at Mercedes-Benz's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, where the company's design center was located. This center housed a dedicated team of talented designers and engineers who worked together to create the iconic look of the 190E.

                Bruno Sacco and his team focused on creating a timeless and aerodynamic design for the 190E. They utilized the latest in computer-aided design (CAD) technology and conducted extensive wind tunnel testing to optimize the car's aerodynamics. The final result was a sleek and elegant silhouette that not only looked visually stunning but also contributed to the car's overall performance and fuel efficiency.
                
                The interior design was equally important, and Mercedes-Benz's team put a strong emphasis on ergonomics, luxury, and attention to detail. High-quality materials, exquisite craftsmanship, and cutting-edge features were incorporated into the 190E's interior to ensure a luxurious and comfortable driving experience.
                
                The Mercedes-Benz 190E was officially unveiled at the 1982 Geneva Motor Show, and it quickly became a symbol of automotive excellence and engineering prowess. Its enduring popularity and legacy are a testament to the dedication and vision of the talented individuals who designed and developed this remarkable compact executive car.

                The Mercedes-Benz 190E also made a significant impact on the motorsport world, particularly in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) racing series. The DTM is a prestigious touring car championship that features highly competitive racing among various automobile manufacturers.

                In the 1980s and 1990s, the Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 was a dominant force in DTM racing. This specially modified version of the 190E was designed for motorsport and featured a powerful 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine producing around 185 horsepower. The car's aerodynamic body kit and suspension setup were optimized for high-speed racing on tracks throughout Europe.

                Notably, the 190E 2.3-16 achieved remarkable success in DTM racing, securing numerous victories and championships for Mercedes-Benz. Its competitive performance and distinctive livery made it a fan-favorite and an iconic representation of Mercedes-Benz's commitment to motorsport excellence.

                The legacy of the 190E in DTM racing lives on, and its achievements continue to be celebrated by motorsport enthusiasts and fans of the Mercedes-Benz brand.
