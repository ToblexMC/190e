        The design of the Mercedes-Benz 190E was a collaborative effort that involved several key individuals and teams within the company. The project was led by Mercedes-Benz's Chief Engineer at the time, Dr. Werner Breitschwerdt, who played a crucial role in overseeing the development of the car. The styling and design work were primarily carried out by a team of designers led by Bruno Sacco, Mercedes-Benz's head of design during that era. The design process took place at Mercedes-Benz's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, where the company's design center was located. This center housed a dedicated team of talented designers and engineers who worked together to create the iconic look of the 190E.

        Bruno Sacco and his team focused on creating a timeless and aerodynamic design for the 190E. They utilized the latest in computer-aided design (CAD) technology and conducted extensive wind tunnel testing to optimize the car's aerodynamics. The final result was a sleek and elegant silhouette that not only looked visually stunning but also contributed to the car's overall performance and fuel efficiency.
        
        The interior design was equally important, and Mercedes-Benz's team put a strong emphasis on ergonomics, luxury, and attention to detail. High-quality materials, exquisite craftsmanship, and cutting-edge features were incorporated into the 190E's interior to ensure a luxurious and comfortable driving experience.
        
        The Mercedes-Benz 190E was officially unveiled at the 1982 Geneva Motor Show, and it quickly became a symbol of automotive excellence and engineering prowess. Its enduring popularity and legacy are a testament to the dedication and vision of the talented individuals who designed and developed this remarkable compact executive car.
