They offer a range of options that can provide various levels of drop and performance improvement while maintaining a comfortable ride for daily driving.<p>

        H&R Springs typically provide a lowering range of around 1.0 to 2.0 inches (25mm to 50mm) depending on the specific model and variant. Please note that the exact lowering amount may vary depending on the year and version of the Mercedes 190E, so it's essential to check the specifications for the specific H&R lowering spring set designed for your vehicle.<p>
  
        Other reputable brands for lowering springs include Eibach and Bilstein, both known for their high-quality lowering springs. As with H&R Springs, these brands offer different spring options tailored to various driving preferences and vehicle models, providing similar lowering ranges for the Mercedes 190E.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="coilovers">
      <p>
        Coilovers are a more versatile suspension upgrade compared to just lowering springs. They consist of
        adjustable dampers and springs, allowing you to fine-tune your car's ride height, damping, and stiffness. If
        you want the ability to customize your suspension setup for both street driving and track use, coilovers are
        the way to go. One of the top choices for Mercedes 190E coilovers is KW Suspensions. Their Variant 3
        coilovers are highly regarded for their performance and adjustability. Another excellent brand to consider
        is Ã–hlins, which offers premium coilover systems for enthusiasts seeking the best in handling and ride
        quality.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="shocks">
      <p>
        If you want to maintain the stock ride height of your Mercedes 190E but still improve its handling, upgrading
        the shocks is a good option. High-performance shock absorbers can provide better damping control, resulting
        in improved stability and comfort. Bilstein is a reputable brand known for producing high-quality shocks.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content" id="alloy">
    <p class="info">
