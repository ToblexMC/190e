    <div class="content" id="loweringSprings">
      <p>
        Lowering springs are an excellent option for improving your car's handling and appearance. They lower the center of gravity, reducing body roll, and improving cornering performance. <p> One of the well-known brands for lowering springs is H&R Springs. They offer a range of options that can provide various levels of drop and performance improvement while maintaining a comfortable ride for daily driving.<p>

        H&R Springs typically provide a lowering range of around 1.0 to 2.0 inches (25mm to 50mm) depending on the specific model and variant. Please note that the exact lowering amount may vary depending on the year and version of the Mercedes 190E, so it's essential to check the specifications for the specific H&R lowering spring set designed for your vehicle.<p>
  
        Other reputable brands for lowering springs include Eibach and Bilstein, both known for their high-quality lowering springs. As with H&R Springs, these brands offer different spring options tailored to various driving preferences and vehicle models, providing similar lowering ranges for the Mercedes 190E.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content" id="coilovers">
      <p>
        Coilovers are a more versatile suspension upgrade compared to just lowering springs. They consist of
        adjustable dampers and springs, allowing you to fine-tune your car's ride height, damping, and stiffness. If
        you want the ability to customize your suspension setup for both street driving and track use, coilovers are
        the way to go. One of the top choices for Mercedes 190E coilovers is KW Suspensions. Their Variant 3
        coilovers are highly regarded for their performance and adjustability. Another excellent brand to consider
        is Ã–hlins, which offers premium coilover systems for enthusiasts seeking the best in handling and ride
        quality.
      </p>

    <div class="content" id="shocks">
      <p>
        If you want to maintain the stock ride height of your Mercedes 190E but still improve its handling, upgrading
        the shocks is a good option. High-performance shock absorbers can provide better damping control, resulting
        in improved stability and comfort. Bilstein is a reputable brand known for producing high-quality shocks.
        Their B8 series is specifically designed for performance applications and can work well with lowering springs
        to enhance your car's handling capabilities. KONI is another respected brand that offers adjustable shock
        absorbers, allowing you to fine-tune the damping to suit your preferences.

    <h3>Exhaust Upgrades for Mercedes 190E</h3>

    <div class="buttons-wrapper">
      <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleSection('catback')">Cat-Back Exhaust</button>
      <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleSection('headers')">Headers</button>
      <button class="collapsible" onclick="toggleSection('highflow')">High-Flow Catalytic Converter</button>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content" id="catback">
      <p class="info">
        Upgrading the exhaust system is a popular way to improve the performance and sound of your Mercedes 190E.<p> One of the common exhaust upgrades is a Cat-Back Exhaust system. A Cat-Back Exhaust replaces the exhaust system from the catalytic converter to the rear of the vehicle. It typically includes the muffler, resonator, and exhaust pipes.<p>
  
        Cat-Back Exhaust systems are designed to reduce exhaust backpressure, which can improve engine efficiency and increase horsepower. Additionally, they often produce a more aggressive and sporty exhaust note, enhancing the overall driving experience.<p> Some well-known brands for Cat-Back Exhaust systems for the Mercedes 190E include Borla, MagnaFlow, and Remus.
  
      <p>  When installing a Cat-Back Exhaust, it's essential to ensure that the system is compatible with your specific model and year of the Mercedes 190E. This will ensure proper fitment and optimal performance.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content" id="headers">
      <p class="info">
        Another exhaust upgrade option is Headers. Headers replace the stock exhaust manifold and are designed to improve exhaust gas flow from the engine's cylinders. They are typically constructed with mandrel-bent tubing for smoother airflow and reduced restrictions.<p>
  
        Headers can enhance engine performance by increasing horsepower and torque. They are particularly beneficial for high-revving engines like the Mercedes 190E's four-cylinder powerplants. By improving exhaust scavenging, headers can contribute to better throttle response and overall engine efficiency.<p>
  
        Brands like Megan Racing, DC Sports, and OBX Racing Sports offer performance headers designed for the Mercedes 190E. Just like with other exhaust upgrades, it's essential to choose headers that are compatible with your specific model and year to ensure proper fitment and performance gains.

    <div class="content" id="highflow">
      <p class="info">
        For enthusiasts looking to optimize both performance and environmental impact, a High-Flow Catalytic Converter is an attractive option. A High-Flow Catalytic Converter is designed to reduce exhaust backpressure while still effectively reducing harmful emissions. <p>
  
        High-flow catalytic converters use advanced catalytic materials and less restrictive designs to maintain compliance with emissions regulations while allowing for improved exhaust flow. By reducing backpressure, they can contribute to increased horsepower and torque.<p>
  
        Brands like MagnaFlow, Flowmaster, and Eastern Catalytic offer High-Flow Catalytic Converters for the Mercedes 190E. When choosing a high-flow catalytic converter, ensure that it meets the emissions requirements in your area and is compatible with your vehicle's specific year and model.
